Introduction to Datawarehouse


DWH is built by combining data from multiple sources(variety of data) and that support analytical reporting

charchterstics of DWH
* Subjeced-orienened
* time variant
* Integrated---[meta data is considered aas schema of the data]
* persitent and non -volatile

Slicing and Dicing
1) Smaller View             1) Combining multiple smaller view
2) Filtering                2) To Zoom into multiple features

## fact vs Dimentional Tbale
_> A fact table contains measurments,Facts,Foreignkeys, to dimension Table. Fact Table is primary table in dimesnional table.
Dimensional Table: Companion Table to fact table that contains descriptive attributes ,to be used as query
* A dimensional table contains dimesion of fact table
* How dimensional table are joins-> Through foreign keys
* Dimensional Table can also contain one or more hierarichal relationships

# Facts vs DImeniosnla Table:
### Keys:
3) primary Key us fact table is maped as foerign key to dimensional Table    3) Dimensional table has primary key column that

uniquely identifies each dimension

### Design:
4) defined by their grain or its most atomic level          4) Dimension able should be wordl






# Star schema vs Snowflake
  
Noramlization is present   ----------------                 No data noramizon is prent <br>
more data storeage is required --------------------                less storgage fiel s required <br>
in start schema the keys are in fact table -------------- in snowflake schema the keys are presnet in other dimesion as well <br>
Query execution should be less in star schema  ------------  query execution echema is more in snowflake shcema <br>


characterstics of SNow flake
snowflake uses smaller disk space
easier to implemet a dimension is added to the schema
more maintencance efforts are needed 


# Normalization in DBMS

Normialization s used to reduce data reduandcey

* Insert anaomiles
* updateing anaomlies
* Deletion anomalies

First Normal Form(1NF)
* Every attribute hold only an atomic(formaing a single unit) value.
* each records need to be unique record.

Second Normal Form(2NF)
* In the second normal form, all non-key attributes are fully functional 
  dependent on the primary key.
  
 third Normal Form(3NF)
 * A relation will be in #NF if it is 2NF and not  contain any transitive partial dependecy.
 X->Y
 y-> not X
 y->Z
 so X->Z then not 3NF
 
 Non prime atttribute us transitelively dependent on primary key
 
 # BCNF(boyce codd normal form)
 
 A given relation is said to be in its third normal form when itâ€™s in 2NF but has no transitive partial dependency. Meaning, when no transitive dependency exists for the attributes that are non-prime, then the relation can be said to be in 3NF.
 
 # day 3[16th March]
 I have started course in linkedin learning APache spark by example
 
 ## SPARK SQL and Data Frames
 * data frame programming abstraction
 * complex analytics with SQL
 
 ## SPARK Streaming
 * process real time data 
 * analyze streaming and historical data
 * use similar code for batch data and real time data

## ML Lib
* provides scalable machine learning
* Works in memory[100 time sfaster than map reduce]

## graphX
* graph computation engine bult on top of spark that eneable working with graph structured data at scale.
* Intoduces a new graph abstraction,the directed multigraph.
* Useful for visuzliaing graphs for social networks.

## Pyspark is written in Scala
pyspark in python wrapper around spark core
## Hadoop

**hadoop is a distributed cluster

* It was the big data platform
* Compute system and storage system closely integrated
